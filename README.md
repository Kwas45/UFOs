# UFOs ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

## UFOs Analysis Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings including filtering for multiple criteria at the same time. This is done by essentially building the webpage the will allow users to view the data (HTML) and a dynamic table that will present it (JavaScript).

### UFOs Results

_1. **THE WEBPAGE**_

The image above represents the final product where users will be able to view data around UFO sightings.

_2. **THE FILTER SEARCH AND DYNAMIC TABLE**_

The image above showcases the filter search panel with various categories such as shape of UFO, location, and date of sighting. The other part displays the tabulated results of the filtered search. The table includes the duration of sighting and the witness comments.  

_3. **FILTERED SEARCH & RESULTS**_

In the image above, a quick search of Sacramento city produces a sighting of a triangular object spotted over the sacramento river. The sighting occured on 1/2/2010 and it lasted for 4 mins. 


### Summary
Although the webpage seems to be able to produce some information of UFO sightings, the data seems to be limited. There isn't enough data on sightings from countries outside the US. Also, there isn't an enter button or clear search button, which will return search results and clear search history quicker and more efficiently. Currently, if the user fails to hit enter the search does not populate. A separate column could be added to the table to let users know of explained UFO occurences proven or otherwise.
